**ABOUT MMGJ**

My Monthly Game Jam - This is my personal game jam that takes place within one month, where only participant is me.  
I come up with an idea for a game (sometimes using generators like https://letsmakeagame.net/game-jam-theme-generator/) and try to implement and release the game within a month  
The game should be a complete finished game. That is - menus, music, gameplay.

Goals of MMGJ:  

*   Practice. Regular practice in drawing, in modeling, in interesting engines, in interesting development languages, in music, in gamemade in principle
*   Actually making games instead of forever "trying"
*   Moving towards an independent developer
